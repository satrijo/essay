                Traditional farming methods require land, time, and manpower, so new farming methods
                have been developed. Nowadays, with urban farming, it is possible to achieve environmental,
                social and economic sustainability for buildings in urban cities<sup><a href="#1" class="text-red-600">[1]</a></sup>
                . The global Covid-19
                lockdown is helping to revive interest in growing at home, but one in ten city households do
                not have access to a garden. Urban farming offers several options such as walls and rooftops,
                while creatively redeveloping the urban environment. Urban farming can turn a growing
                number of consumers into producers. Changes in consumer behavior can contribute to
                environmental conservation and climate change mitigation. In addition, urban farming can
                produce higher quality vegetables or fruits, provide additional income for those who do it,
                and can expand social networks.
            </p>

            <h1 class="pt-2 font-sans -mb-4 text-2xl font-semibold">Social Impact</h1>

            <p class="py-6">The findings prove that even on a small scale, urban
            farming can contribute to build social networks that
            provide practical and emotional support. In the
            context of urban farming, small backyard food garden
            can connect some people with neighbors, where this
            social network occurs at three levels: (a) creating
            friendships; (b) expanding the network of
            acquaintances with other urban farmers; and (c)
            increasing several influential networks in government,
            civil society and markets. Generally, urban farming
            participants come from heterogeneous group.
            Personal motivation for urban farming is usually
            related to the experience of nature, for example
            through the joy of gardening, pursuing a sustainable
            lifestyle and protecting the environment. Besides,
            social and ecological aspects are also found to be the
            main drivers of the establishment of several urban
            farming projects, as one of the study showed
            participation in social discourse as a grassroots
            democracy was established by 127 projects to call for
            more use of green public spaces in urban areas<sup><a href="#2" class="text-red-600">[2]</a></sup>
            .</p>

            <h1 class="pt-2 font-sans -mb-4 text-2xl font-semibold">Health Impact</h1>

            <p class="py-6">The growth of urban farming can also help to change
            people's perspective on food products that have
            higher quality and are free from the use of chemical
            pesticides. The main health impacts associated with
            urban farming include: (a) increased consumption of
            bio-foods; and (b) improvements in mental and
            physical health, e.g. mood and life satisfaction. Several
            studies have shown that for some urban farmers,
            growing their own food helps them to diversify their
            family's diet and to have greater access to fresh
            vegetables and fruit. In addition, going outside to
            nature can help reduce stress and their tendency to
            choose unhealthy foods. In fact, based on
            epidemiological studies, the elderly who do urban
            farming have better health indicator scores than those
            who do not<sup><a href="#3" class="text-red-600">[3]</a></sup>
            .</p>

            <h1 class="pt-2 font-sans -mb-4 text-2xl font-semibold">Economic Impact</h1>
            <p class="py-6">The importance of agriculture is that it allows
            production to be a source of income and a source of
            food supply. In fact, increasing urban farming
            development in the community can help to diversify
            household income and increase women's agency, e.g.
            housewives can empower urban farming as a micro
            business opportunity or improve their skills. As
            reported by World Bank’s Urban Development and
            Resilience Unit which conducted case studies on urban
            farming in four cities: Bangalore (India), Accra (Ghana),
            Nairobi (Kenya) and Lima (Peru). The results show that
            the impact of urban farming in these cities includes
            providing employment and income for urban farmers,
            as well as contributing to food security and nutrition<sup><a href="#4" class="text-red-600">[4]</a></sup>
            .</p>

            <h1 class="pt-2 font-sans -mb-4 text-2xl font-semibold">Challenges & Barriers</h1>
            <p class="py-6">Although urban farming has many benefits, there are several challenges and barriers. A literature review identified
            barriers
            that hinder urban farming: (1) limited access to land; (2) inadequate infrastructure and supporting services; and (3)
            lack of
            skills and experience in urban farming<sup><a href="#5" class="text-red-600">[5]</a></sup>. Furthermore, several findings indicate that urban farming activities in
            several big
            cities have not been well documented. Three out of five urban farmers have difficulty authenticating information about
            permitted land uses for this farming method. For this reason, it is necessary to develop a policy review by taking into
            account
            the existing policies related to urban farming guidelines, sanitation systems, and water resources. In reality, there is
            a gap
            between policy and implementation where environmentally friendly policies already exist in several places but there are
            challenges in their implementation in the field. In addition, the results of a study also show that there are still many
            urban
            planners who have not included urban farming in the urban development literature<sup><a href="#5" class="text-red-600">[5]</a></sup>. Generally, the role of urban
            planners
            is quite important for the advancement of urban farming because they can assist the government in determining the area
            of land use and a set of regulations governing agriculture in accordance with their authority.</p>

            <p class="py-6">In reality, most urban farmers do not own their own land. Most of them only use a small area for farming. Those who want
            to cultivate more land should be able to own their own land or rent someone else's land. Farmers who rent land must be
            prepared to face the risk of sudden increases in rental costs by landowners. Long-term ownership or land leases need to
            be
            secured which is likely to encourage more land investment in the future. Vacant land is usually touted as a potential
            opportunity for urban farming. This land is a tantalizing option for those looking for land for cultivation, but due to
            the high
            cost of land, this poses a challenge for urban farmers. As a result, some urban farmers are exploring ways to make land
            more economical and ergonomic to restore land that does not cost millions of dollars. In the future, farmers must be
            prepared if there are restrictions on land use. Some countries such as Bangkok[1] have land use and zoning regulations
            that
            severely limit land availability in urban environments, e.g. prohibition of building greenhouses in cities and
            restrictions on
            the height of plants grown.</p>

            <p class="py-6">
                Another challenge for urban farming is gaining access to water and dealing with water runoff as reported by 20% of urban
                farmers and 23% of urban planners in Chicago<sup><a href="#5" class="text-red-600">[5]</a></sup>. For many urban farmers, a water source is important for watering crops.
                Access to water means finding land equipped with pipes and taps for water which is reportedly quite difficult in some
                places<sup><a href="#4" class="text-red-600">[4]</a></sup>. If the land area does not have good drainage, it means that other water sources are needed which will likely
                cost
                a lot of money. In most developing countries, the use of wastewater for agriculture, in both urban and rural areas, is a
                common practice especially in water-scarce areas. In some countries, standards for the use of wastewater for agriculture
                have been set, but in the field, there is still misunderstanding about the use of wastewater where untreated wastewater
                is
                still found. It should be noted that the use of untreated wastewater may pose a risk to human health as it may contain
                toxic
                chemicals, sewage-related pathogens, and other hazardous residues. For this reason, in the development of urban farming,
                it is recommended to use good water sources such as treated wastewater. Basically, if the wastewater is managed
                properly,
                it can be safely used to support crop production through direct irrigation or by filling aquifers. However, to do this
                requires
                the development of good wastewater treatment indicators.
            </p>

            <p class="py-6">
                Urban agricultural crops will generally be affected by changes in atmospheric conditions and microclimate in urban
                ecosystems<sup><a href="#6" class="text-red-600">[6]</a></sup>
                . Urban cities face the challenges of microclimate change due to urban heat island (UHI). Vegetation
                reforestation activities such as urban farming turned out to be a very effective adaptation tool to cool UHI, but in
                reality
                urban farming also has to face the impact of UHI. The urban atmospheric environment and microclimate are affected by a
                complex set of anthropogenic factors with temperature, CO2, relative humidity, and wind which differ from the rural
                environment. Essentially, UHI can contribute to higher day time temperatures, reduced night time cooling and higher
                levels
                of air pollution. This situation can affect the plant growth cycle in urban areas, so that it becomes one of the
                challenges for
                urban farming. Some findings analyze that the problem of UHI lies in the magnitude of the increase in recent decades due
                to global warming. Therefore, it is urgent to reduce the magnitude to an acceptable level, but doing this can be tricky.
                Based
                on this, it is very necessary to develop technology and planting techniques that can be adapted to the microclimate of
                an
                area. Fundamentally, knowledge of how urban microclimates can affect crop production is still limited. More studies on
                the
                adaptation of plants and cultivars to the urban environment will provide practical recommendations for urban farmers,
                especially in advancing the understanding of plant physiological responses to complex urban ecosystems<sup><a href="#4" class="text-red-600">[4]</a></sup>. In addition,
                the
                characterization of urban microclimates can help in development of plant hardiness zones in urban areas and knowing what
                planting calendars can be used in urban areas<sup><a href="#6" class="text-red-600">[6]</a></sup>. In the long term, information on plant physiological responses in
                urban
                environments can be used for the development of adaptive and more competitive fruit and vegetable cultivars in urban
                ecosystems.
